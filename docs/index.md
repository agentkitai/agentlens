## Quick Start

Get AgentLens running in 60 seconds:

```bash
# Install and start the server
npx @agentkitai/agentlens-server

# Create an API key
curl -X POST http://localhost:3400/api/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-agent"}'
```

Then add AgentLens to your MCP agent config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentlens": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@agentkitai/agentlens-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENTLENS_API_URL": "http://localhost:3400",
        "AGENTLENS_API_KEY": "als_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Open **http://localhost:3400** and watch your agent's activity in real time.
