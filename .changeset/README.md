# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the readme](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md)

**What is a changeset?** A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds
three bits of information:

- What we need to release
- What semver bump type we need
- A summary of the change
