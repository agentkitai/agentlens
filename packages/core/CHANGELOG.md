# @agentlensai/core

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a8c268: Centralize LLM model pricing in a new `@agentkit/pricing` package, sourced from LiteLLM's published prices with an embedded fallback.

  - Consolidates the two server-side cost tables (`@agentlensai/core` `DEFAULT_MODEL_COSTS` and the cloud `batch-writer` table) onto one source of truth — they had drifted in both units (per-1M vs per-1K) and model coverage.
  - Fixes the cloud-ingest path, which previously returned no cost for modern model ids (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`) because its hand-maintained table used outdated key formats.
  - Refreshes prices live from LiteLLM at server startup (fire-and-forget, falls back to the embedded table on failure). Off-switch: `AGENTKIT_PRICING_REFRESH=false`.

  `@agentlensai/core` continues to re-export `DEFAULT_MODEL_COSTS` / `lookupModelCost` and now also exports `costUsd` and `refreshFromLiteLLM` — no breaking change for existing consumers.

- 18428ae: Add compliance evals on the tamper-evident audit trail (#55, Phase 1).

  A deterministic compliance scorer evaluates a completed session's events against policy rules — denied tools (`tool_denylist`, supports `delete_*` wildcards), `tool_allowlist`, `max_cost`, and a `no_severity_above` ceiling — with no LLM dependency, so the result is provable and reproducible.

  - New `eval_result` event type + `EvalResultPayload`. The scoring outcome is emitted server-side as a SHA-256 hash-chained event in the session's audit trail, so eval results are themselves tamper-evident evidence ("we ran the eval, here's the cryptographic proof"). It is deliberately excluded from the public ingest schema so clients cannot forge eval results.
  - New endpoint `POST /api/eval/sessions/:sessionId/compliance` — scores a completed session against inline `rules` and records the chained `eval_result`. Strict pass/fail by default; an optional `passThreshold` switches to score-based.
  - `compliance` scorer type registered in the default scorer registry; `ScorerConfig.rules` carries the policy rules.
